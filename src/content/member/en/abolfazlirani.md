# Hello, I'm Abolfazl Irani
From the very first time I sat at a computer, I felt like I was sitting in my own spaceship, piloting and controlling it.
The sheer number of buttons and the many things you could do with a computer excited me—I could manage something that not everyone could.

I started working with computers at the age of 16 and tried my hand at most programming languages at least once or twice.
But at 18, when I learned Java more professionally, my career path became clear.
Now, I've been working with Flutter for about five years, and with the help of my teammates and the companies I've collaborated with,
I've been able to build really great apps that I’m proud of.

While programming, I also became interested in Photoshop and user interface design, and for a while, I worked as a designer alongside coding.
However, I realized I didn't have that much creative flair, so I decided to focus all my time on programming and really hone that craft.

I'm especially interested in creating complex applications involving audio and video, or working with sockets.
I've always wanted the projects I work on to be challenging and intricate, because they make me feel like that pilot again. :)
