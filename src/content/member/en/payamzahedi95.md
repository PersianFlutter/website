# Hi, I'm Payam Zahedi  
I currently live in **Berlin** and work as a **software engineer** at a German company. Besides that, I'm the developer of the **[Toastification](https://payamzahedi.com/toastification/)** package, and I dedicate most of my free time to improving this Flutter package.  

Another passion of mine is **sharing what I know**. Thatâ€™s why I love being part of **developer communities and conferences**, where I try to share my knowledge and experiences.  

## My Expertise  
My main expertise is **Flutter and mobile software development**, but I also have experience in other fields due to my personal interests:  

- Building **static websites** with **Astro**  
- Developing **Embedded applications**  
- Working on **DIY projects**  
- Smart home automation with **Home Assistant**  
- Experimenting with **AI models** and working with them  
- And much more...  

## My Interests  
Iâ€™m highly passionate about **Open Source projects** and actively contribute to the **Open Source** section of the **Flutter Persian community**.
